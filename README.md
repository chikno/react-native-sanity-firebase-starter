## Before you start




in order to manage releases flow and app versions and builds , we need to update our EAS_PROJECT_ID and EXPO_PROJECT_OWNER.
If you done have an expo account , Create one at https://expo.dev/, then create a project , you can easily grab those infos in your expo project dashboard. 
Once we have those infos , please update the .env.* file with the correct values.

```sh
const EXPO_ACCOUNT_OWNER = 'sanity-firebase-expo-react-native'; // expo account owner
const EAS_PROJECT_ID = 'your-expo-project-id'; // eas project id
```

 We need to set up some environnement variables. 
### Sanity.io configuration : 
- please follow the documentation in our Sanity services booking starter https://github.com/chikno/sanity-services-booking-starter

Once we have the project set up on sanity , please copy the PROJECT_ID and the DATASET_NAME , 
then open the .env.development or .env.staging or .env.production file , it depends on wich environnement we are deploying then , replace the SANITY_PROJECT_ID and SANITY_DATA_SET_NAME with the correct variables

### Firebase configuration

We are using Firebase for authentication and firestore to store user Personal informations and User Booking Data.
To configure Firebase auth using expo , please follow the following steps in expo official docs : 
https://docs.expo.dev/guides/using-firebase/
once you have the following values , please uopdate yout .env.x files

```sh
  apiKey: 'api-key',
  authDomain: 'project-id.firebaseapp.com',
  databaseURL: 'https://project-id.firebaseio.com',
  projectId: 'project-id',
  storageBucket: 'project-id.appspot.com',
  messagingSenderId: 'sender-id',
  appId: 'app-id',
  measurementId: 'G-measurement-id',
```

and we are ready to go further with the next steps.
